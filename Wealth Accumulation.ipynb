    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By investing 5,000 dollars annually into any of these index funds or ETFs beginning at 25 years old, on average, you can expect to see returns well into the \\\\$6 million range by the time you turn 65 years old. OEF offers the highest potential return, however along with this they do charge the highest expense ratio out of these options at 0.20%. In my opinion, the battle is between VOO, SPY, and OEF. VOO offers the lowest expense ratio, however OEF offers the highest dividend yield. SPY offers a lower expense ratio than OEF and a higher dividend yield than VOO. The potential gain for VOO is higher than that of SPY, however lower than that of OEF. The standard deviation of said gain is lowest for SPY meaning the chances of getting the average annual return is highest for SPY.\n",
    "\n",
    "However risk averse you are when it comes to your retirement savings will determine which of these three ETFs you choose to invest in. The highest potential gain is OEF, however this comes with the highest expense ratio as well. To counter this high expense ratio, OEF offers the highest dividend yield. Of these three choices, the \"safest\" would be SPY. SPY offers potentially great returns at the lowest standard deviation. If you're willing to take a little more risk for a potential higher payout than that of SPY, invest in VOO as it has the lowest expense ratio and still offers a potential for great returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just remember, past performance is no guarantee of future results."
