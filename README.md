# Wealth-Accumulation

This is simply a Monte Carlo simulation of 1 million possible futures of returns that you can get from a few well-known ETFs and index funds. By using historic data for the standard deviation and average return from Morningstar, you can use Monte Carlo simulation to predict a number of futures and by averaging those futures, you can get a good idea about what you can expect based on the historical success of the fund.
